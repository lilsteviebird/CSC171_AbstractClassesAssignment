Lab Days: Tuesday, Thursday 9:40-10:55
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment

Class that extends DriversLicense but adds a new value that this class is for Truck drivers
 */
 
 Each individual class contains the requirements with respect to its name that was dicatated from the assignment sheet. 
 Please go to the runner class to test the files, please comment out what you don't want to test, currently the portion testing
 Person, student etc is commented out, not because there is an issue, but because I was testing the License classes and
 the console was cleaner that way.
